# conda.local

A local install of anaconda... just drop this anywhere and run install.
__Note__: depending on how old the `Miniconda3-latest-*.sh` file is, it might
make sense to update it. Simply run:
```bash
./update_installer
```

## Installing:

Just run:
```bash
./install_conda.sh
```


## Using

Just run:
```bash
./source env.sh
```


### Files

1. `miniconda3` -- the install dir for the local anaconda tool (and everything
   it installs, including environments).

2. `tmp` -- a temporary directory used by installers. This should be empty
   (installers clean up after themselves unless something goes wrong).

3. `env.local` -- setings local to this install. This file is generated by
   `install_conda.sh` and used by `env.sh` to set the `PATH`.
